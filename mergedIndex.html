<footer><div>The interactive education expenditure dashboard of OECD countries consists of an interactive map and a line chart. It provides a view of expenditures by country and year, allowing the user to monitor changes in education spending over the years and intervene where deemed useful.
  The first chart of the dashboard is an interactive globe map with functionalities for selecting a country, focusing, and rotating. The data is visualized on the countries based on their expenditure values according to the legend at the bottom of the map, aiming for quick data reading. There is also the option for more precise reading of countries' expenditures by hovering the mouse cursor over the countries. Additionally, selecting a country brings it to the center and colors it yellow, activating the label with its expenditure value.
  The second chart is a line graph that visualizes the evolution of education funding since 2000. The goal is to provide a view of the trends in countries' education expenditures over time. The user has the option to select a country from the dropdown menu, also providing the option to see all countries together for comparison. Selecting an individual country displays the line with its expenditure values over time. The lines and peaks of the chart are interactive and can be selected directly from the graph without using the menu. The peaks also provide information with labels when hovering the cursor over them.
  The map and the line chart function complementarily, as there is both an immediate color-based reading of the map and a detailed annual presentation of education funding in the chart. The integration of the two visualizations provides easy comparison and analysis of trends and data.
